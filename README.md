# Kmers-distance in Fasta Files(Genomic sequences)
Repository contains information about:
1. Reading "Fasta" files using Biopython Package.
2. Generating k-mer sequences from the file.
3. Calculating Jaccard distance between gene sequences.
4. Hashing the sequence using mmh3 library and calculating the Jaccard distance.
